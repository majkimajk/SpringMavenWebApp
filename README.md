# SpringMavenWebApp

A simple Java web application, built with Maven. It has two funcionalities:

1) Management Panel
It allows the user to read, add, edit and delete customers' details. Data is stored and read from a mySQL database.
The funcionalities are created by using Spring and Hibernate frameworks.

2) GeoLoc
It gives user the choice to either search desired address by entering it's geographical coordinates or getting the coordinates of the desired address. Funcionalities are enabled by Google Maps API, however, the HTTP request are made from scratch (without using Google's API shortcut mathods), for training purposes.
